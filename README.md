# Accessible Drag-and-Drop

Examples of drag-and-drop patterns that are accessible via mouse, keyboard, and screen reader. These examples are built using React. To learn more about these patterns, read Jesse Hausler's "[4 Major Patterns for Accessible Drag and Drop](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/4-major-patterns-for-accessible-drag-and-drop-1d43f64ebf09)" on the [Salesforce UX blog](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux).
